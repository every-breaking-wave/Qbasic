# QBasic
This is the second project of SJTU Software College SEP course, although it is only 15 points of the 1-credit course, I have spent much effort on it, although there are definitely still a lot of bugs, it is barely up to the requirements, for the reference of later SEers.

I noticed that some parts of the code could be deleted, such as statemen.h, etc., but after the deletion of the compilation of some problems, so it was retained.
